The program prompts the user to input the basic salary then the benefits
It calculates the gross salary by adding the basic salary and the benefits.
Then calculates the NSSF deductions and NHIF contribution and deducts from the gross salary.
The total of the deductions is deducted from the gross salary to get the taxable income which is then used to calculate the tax according to rates per salary.
It then calculates the Net salary which is the gross salary minus tax, NHIF and NSSF deductions.
